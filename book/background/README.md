Background
======

The development of software is a systems design problem, with systems embedded within a collection of systems; technological, economic and political (so called Systems of Systems).

Heightened pressure to design high quality systems with limited resources, in a context of increasingly complex and interdependent systems - intensifies the need to get design "right" and mitigate the impacts of failure.

A consistent problem in systems design and development is the gap between expectation and reality, too often system development projects do not deliver the promised benefits, or even reach completion.

This document synthesizes the experience of contributors, firstly to design and then to develop systems, which are fundamentally honest, congruent with expectations and their context.

Our motivation is to improve the quality of systems through better design, ultimately serving all stakeholders of systems - that is, everyone.

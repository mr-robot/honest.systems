# From Constraints

Start from Constraints

An honest system design acknowledges, and then resolves constraints - either incorporating them or isolating them from the other aspects of the design.

All designs are embedded within a system defined by constraints and limitations, by resolving constraints as a component of design it ensures designs can be realised.

The designer should identify the hierachy of constraints which are imposed upon the design by the economic, social and technological systems

# Bounds Uncertainty

Resolve to Certainty

An honest system design, always identifies areas of risk and uncertainty, and then resolves them - through design mechanisms, analysis or modelling.

Bounding uncertainty provides two crucial elements required for buildability and management - stability (does this system behave consistently over time?) and clarity (what is going on in this system?)

The areas of uncertainty the designer should analyse in detail, are based on risk - regarding reliability of inputs, environment change, known and unknown organisation level risks.

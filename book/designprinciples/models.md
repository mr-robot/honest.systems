# Models

Model what matters

An honest.system design models the system to represent how it responds to inputs and the environment.

The right models will focus on resolving areas of uncertainty and risk which are crucial to the success of the design.

The key is not to model irrelevant or unimportant aspects of the design, but instead to ensure the design throughly understands hows it responds to crucial concerns.

The primary value of models is not descriptive, but predictive - improving the designers understanding of how their design performs in practice, prior to implementation.

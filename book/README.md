In the present, the design of distributed systems is a complex engineering problem, honest.systems is a methodology to guide the successful design and development of systems in this environment.

The honest.systems is a methodology that:

 - Puts focus on the minimum viable system functions, offering the maximum yield of benefit per feature
 - Creates systems which can react and support an environment of change and uncertainty

The honest.systems methodology can be applied to systems which are built using any technology, but works best on digital distributed systems.
